#### [The Paradox of Pledgeability][Paradox] 
with  [Denis Gromb][denis]  and [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia], 2018 (accepted at the **JFE**)

We develop a model in which collateral serves to protect creditors from the claims of competing creditors. We find that collateralized borrowing has a cost: it encumbers assets, constraining future borrowing and investment---there is a collateral overhang.




#### [Household Debt Overhang and Unemployment][HHD] 

with [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia] and [Anjan Thakor][anjan], 2019 (in the **JF** 74)

We use a labor-search model to explain why the worst employment slumps often follow expansions of household debt. We find that households protected by limited liability suffer from a household-debt-overhang problem that leads them to require high wages to work. Firms respond by posting high wages but few vacancies. This *vacancy posting effect* implies that high household debt leads to high unemployment. Even though households borrow from banks via bilaterally optimal contracts, the equilibrium level of household debt is inefficiently high due to a *household-debt externality.* We analyze the role that a financial regulator can play in mitigating this externality

<!----
NB: the working paper version focused on household risk-shifting, rather than debt overhang.  It is retitled [Household Risk-shifting in the Labor Market] [BL].

####[Contracting to Compete for Flows][m] 
with [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia], 2018 (in **JET** 173)

Delegated asset managers frequently refer to public information, such as credit ratings and benchmark indicies, in the contracts they offer their investors. However, regulators have advised against this. Why do asset managers refer to public information in their contracts? We show that it is a way for asset managers to compete for flows of investor capital, even though it is socially inefficient.


#### [Warehouse Banking][WB] 
with [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia] and [Anjan Thakor][anjan], 2018 (in the  **JFE** 129)

We develop a theory of banking that explains why banks started out as commodities warehouses. Our theory helps to explain how modern banks create funding liquidity and why they combine warehousing (custody and deposit-taking), lending, and private money creation within the same institutions.



####[Resaleable Debt and Systemic Risk][n] 
with [Eva Micheler][eva], 2018 (in the **JFE** 127)


Many debt claims, such as bonds, are resaleable, whereas others, such as repos, are not. We develop a model of bank lending in which debt claims are heterogenous in their resaleability. We find that decreasing credit market frictions leads to an increase in borrowing via non-resaleable debt.  This causes credit chains to form, creating systemic risk.


#### [Deadlock on the Board][DL] 

with [Nadya Malenko][nadya] and [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia], 2018 (revise and resubmit at the **RFS**)

Best Paper Award at the 2018 ASU Sonoran Winter Finance Conference

In a dynamic model of board decision making, directors strategically block proposals that benefit other directors. Such deadlock on the board explains CEO entrenchment and strategic inertia. We study how board composition affects deadlock, and find, for example, that board diversity can exacerbate it.




#### [Intermediation Variety][IV] 
with [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia] and [Anjan Thakor][anjan], 2019 (revise and resubmit at the **JF**)

Non-depository financial intermediaries ("non-banks") have a higher cost of capital than depositories ("banks") do, e.g., because they do not benefit from a moneyness premium on deposits or government safety nets. How do they still compete with banks?  Non-banks use their high cost of capital as a commitment device not to fund traditional projects, inducing entrepreneurs to innovative efficiently.


#### [Conflicting Priorities: A Theory of Covenants and Collateral][Priorities] 
with  [Denis Gromb][denis]  and [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia], 2018

We develop a model in which the absolute priority of secured debt leads to conflicts among creditors, but can be optimal nonetheless.  The option to use collateral to dilute unsecured debt, even in  violation of covenants, loosens financial constraints that could be inefficiently tight.  But covenants embed an acceleration option that prevents these constraints from becoming inefficiently loose.


 
#### [The Opportunity Cost of Collateral][OC] 

with [Mina Lee][mina] and [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia], 2018


Interbank debt is money-like, but not a perfect substitute for cash: it can be hard to convert to cash to fund new investments. Hence, interbank lending comes with an opportunity cost that generates positive spreads even absent any credit risk. These spreads enter banks' collateral constraints, generating a feedback between the opportunity cost in the credit market and the price of collateral in the asset market. This results in instability in the form of multiple equilibria, casting light on repo runs. We provide a new rational for counter-cyclical capital regulation.

 
#### [Money Runs][MR] 

with [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia], 2018

We present a banking model in which bank debt is traded over the counter like banknotes were in the nineteenth century and repos are today. This focus on bank money creation reveals a new rationale for demandable debt and a new type of bank run, or "money run."








#### [Procyclical Promises][PP] 

2018


I explore how the cyclicality of firms' output affects their debt capacity. I point out that, in contrast to received theory, procyclical firms can have an advantage in the funding market: because they have more assets in booms, when asset prices are high ex post, they have looser collateral constraints ex ante---assets are useful as collateral only when they are valuable. 

#### [Netting][N] 

with [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia], 2018

Banks hold gross debts without netting them out.  Why?  These gross debts implement valuable contingent transfers via the option to dilute.
