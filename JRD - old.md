#### Firm Size and Financial Constraints (with Alkis Georgiadis-Harris)

In a critical resource model of the firm, an entrepreneur has a project but insufficient capital and limited collateral.  Taking on partners increases the seizure value of the assets but may hamper the organization's internal productivity.   This trade-off determines the equilibrium size of the firm in a game constituting coalition-formation, secured borrowing, effort exertion, and ex post opportunism both between the firm and the creditor and among the inside partners. The theory predicts that a firm's size depends on the left-hand side of its balance sheet: the more effectively its assets can be transferred or liquidated, the smaller is the organization.  When seizure is expensive the firm is large, as it is when it depends heavily on outside capital.


#### [Investment Mandates and the Downside of Precise Credit Ratings][m]
with [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia]

In a problem of delegated portfolio choice, competitive risk-averse agents offer a risk-averse investor contracts depending on portfolio weights and final wealth as well as a public signal, for example an asset's credit rating.  The optimal contract is affine in wealth and implements both  efficient investment and optimal risk-sharing for each realization of the public signal, but agents' competition drives them to write the public signal into their contracts and prevent risk-sharing over it, a result reminiscent of Hirshleifer (1971).  We comment on applications to asset managers' investment mandates and advocate regulation of credit rating agencies to prohibit their publishing information in forms conducive to inclusion in rigid contracts.

#### Liquidity in Two-sided Markets: Payment Systems and the Boundaries of the Firm 

In a two-period extension of the two-sided market model in Donaldson (2012), intermediaries are payment platforms that transform consumer utility into firm revenue intertemporally: they act as a medium of exchange that satsifies double coincidence of wants in a dimension the cash does not---across dates---analogously to credit card or bank overdraft systems.

Consumers purchase at either the early or late date with preference for early consumption but no money until the late date.  Their cardinal preference for early consumption is called the ``liquidity demand''. At equilibrium consumers buy early so long as the cost of intermediation is not too high and the magnetude of liquidity demand determines the prices.

At an earlier stage firms can bring payment systems in-house (merge with intermediaries) and potentially reduce the per-transaction cost of intermediation.  When liquidity demand is low, the transactions cost theory à la Coase and Williamson determines the boundaries of the firm: they integrate exactly when they can cut the cost of intermediation in so doing.  When liquidity demand is high, however, outsourcing allows firms to commit to their transaction rates and they outsource even when it is less cost efficient.  Thus not only firms' tecnologies but also consumers' liquidity constraints determine firm size and scope.


#### Money as Renegotiation: A Model of Payment Intermediaries as Firm Commitment ####

In a two-sided market model most similar to Armstrong (1996), intermediaries are payment platforms defined by the technology to transform consumer utility into firm revenue.  Two retail firms empoloy sell imperfect substites on the Hotelling line and employ the platforms to intermediate their transactions with consumers.

Outside money allows consumers and firms to bilaterally renegotiate multilateral intermediarated contracts, costing firms commitment power.  Intermediaries' margial cost of doing business determines the paper that circulates in the economy: for high intermediation costs, firms accept cash; for intermediate intermediation costs, firms play a stag-hunt in which commiting not to accept cash is the payoff dominant equilibrium; for low intermedation costs firms are trapped in a prisoners' dilemma in which they both accept cash despite the superior profits that they could glean if only inside money circulated.  


#### [Overrating Agencies: Competition, Collusion, and Regulation][or] ###

with [Giorgia Piacentino][giorgia]

We model the rating agencies’ assessment of corporate securities issues with competitive, profit-maximizing agencies certifying issuers whose project choice depends on the value they can fetch for their issue in the market, namely on their anticipated rating. We begin our analysis with a static monopolistic setting and progressively expand it to end up studying repeated issues and endogenously colluding agencies. In the static environment where there is only one issue a monopolistic agency always overrates to maximize its profits. Since good firms anticipate that the credit rating agencies will make them unable to distinguish themselves by pooling them with bad ones, they pass over positive NPV investment opportunities. Competition ameliorates the situation: Rating agencies are not only honest but cheap, setting prices equal to marginal costs à la Bertrand competition. Firms undertake all good investment opportunities. However, when rating agencies interact repeatedly they are liable to collude. Our main result rests on the number of good investment opportunities in the market. When they are plentiful, like at the beginning of an economic upturn, rating agencies are honest and good firms innovate. Credit rating agencies set their fees so high, however, that some firms with positive NPV projects stay out of the market to avoid the cost of being rated. At the height of the boom, however, after new investments have dried up, ratings agencies start to overrate and firms thus stop investing.

We show the amplifying effect rating agencies had in the last crisis: First investment opportunities waned in accordance with the business cycle, and then ratings agencies’ practices changed resulting in a further choking off of investment and fomenting economic collapse.



## Research in Progress

#### Collateral Dynamics 
with [Jean-Pierre Zigrand][JP]

We study the effects of derivatives margin constraints on real production in a continuous time set-up with endogenous risk.  The return on collateral is lower than the risk-free rate.

#### Diversification Causes Correlation 
with Colm Friel 

We show that the expansion of banks into new markets induces endogenous correlation in real production and asset prices in a simple dynamic model in which bank's capital constraints ration entrepreneurs' investment.
