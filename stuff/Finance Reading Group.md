# Finance Reading Group  #  

I am currently in charge of organizing an finance reading group which takes place on Thursday evenings at six p.m. in Old 6.06 (except for in Week 3 and Week 5 when it is in R407 and CON 1.03, respectively).

Daniel Ferreira selects a paper each week and has decided that we will start with work from some of this years job market candidates.

## Week 2

This week we will discuss Silvia Petriconi's paper [Bank Competition, Information Choice and Inefficient Lending Booms][2]
