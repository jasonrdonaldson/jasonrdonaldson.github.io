# Finance Reading Group  #  

I am currently in charge of organizing a reading group which takes place on Thursday evenings at six p.m. in Old 6.06 (except for in Week 3 when it is in R407 and Week 5 when it is in CON 1.03).

Daniel Ferreira selects a paper each week; we will start with work from some of this year's job market candidates.

## Week 3

This week we will discuss Jacopo Ponticelli's paper [Court Enforcement and Firm Productivity: Evidence from a Bankruptcy Reform in Brazil][3].  Note that he is presenting in the lunchtime seminar on the Tuesday before the reading group (29 January at one p.m. in R405).

## Week 2

This week we will discuss Silvio Petriconi's paper [Bank Competition, Information Choice and Inefficient Lending Booms][2].
